Sign in with Google, screenshot a job posting, get a fit check, a JD-tailored ATS-safe
resume, and a drafted email — reviewed before anything sends. Applications are tracked
per account (company, role, date applied, resume, email, follow-ups) and sync across
devices. Each user connects their own AI provider key (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini) —
nothing is billed to anyone but the account that added the key.

## Setup — do this once

You'll create a free Firebase project (Google's own product — this is what makes
"Sign in with Google" nearly zero-config) and wire a few environment variables into
Vercel. None of this can be done on your behalf; it needs your Google account.

### 1. Create the Firebase project
1. [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) → **Add project** → name it anything → you can skip Google Analytics.
2. **Build → Authentication → Get started → Sign-in method → Google → Enable.** Pick a support email. Save.
3. **Build → Firestore Database → Create database → Production mode** → pick any region close to you.
4. **Firestore → Rules tab** → paste the contents of `firestore.rules` → **Publish**.

### 2. Get the web app config (safe to be public)
1. Project **⚙️ Settings → General → Your apps → Add app → Web** (the `</>` icon). Register it (no need for Firebase Hosting).
2. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object it shows you.
3. Paste those values into `firebase-init.js`, replacing the `REPLACE_WITH_...` placeholders.
4. **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains** → add your Vercel production domain (e.g. `your-app.vercel.app`) — Google sign-in's popup will fail on a domain that isn't listed here.

### 3. Get the server-side service account (this one's a secret)
1. Project **⚙️ Settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key** → downloads a JSON file.
2. Base64-encode the whole file into one line:
   ```bash
   base64 -i path/to/serviceAccountKey.json | tr -d '\n'
   ```
3. In Vercel → your project → **Settings → Environment Variables**, add:
   - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` = the base64 string from above
   - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` = output of `openssl rand -hex 32` (this encrypts everyone's provider keys at rest — keep it secret, losing it means saved keys can't be decrypted and everyone has to re-add theirs)
4. Redeploy so the new env vars take effect.

### 4. Try it
1. Open the deployed URL, **Sign in with Google**.
2. Go to **Profile → AI providers** → pick one and hit **Get a key →** (Gemini's free tier at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) is the easiest first key — no billing required).
3. Paste it, **Save key** — it's validated against the provider immediately, then encrypted and stored.
4. Back on Capture, screenshot a job posting.

## Deploy

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel          # preview
vercel --prod   # production
```

Or connect this GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard (**Add New → Project → Import Git
Repository**) — framework preset **Other**, leave build/output settings blank. Every
push then redeploys automatically.

## Security model

- **Provider keys never round-trip to the browser.** `save-provider-key.js` accepts a key once, validates it against the provider, encrypts it (AES-256-GCM, server-only `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, bound to the owning account via authenticated-data), and stores it in a Firestore collection (`serverOnly_providerKeys`) that `firestore.rules` denies to every client SDK call — `allow read, write: if false`. The only way in is the Admin SDK, which only runs inside Vercel's serverless functions, authenticated with the service account. The client can only ask "is a key configured?" and gets back a boolean plus a masked last-4 preview.
- **Every key use is scoped to its owner.** Each request that needs a provider key (`job-extract`, `job-generate`, `job-followup`, and the docx endpoint) verifies the caller's Firebase ID token server-side (`_firebaseAdmin.js`, with revocation checking) before touching Firestore, and looks the key up by that verified `uid` — there's no path for one account to use another's key.
- **Your data is yours.** `users/{uid}` and `users/{uid}/applications/*` are readable/writable only by `request.auth.uid == uid`, enforced by Firestore rules on every direct client read/write.
- **A provider key only grants API usage**, billed to whoever added it — it is not the same as a ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro/Gemini Advanced subscription and can't touch anything outside that provider's API.
- Error responses returned to the browser are generic; the actual upstream error detail is only logged server-side (Vercel function logs), so provider error bodies never round-trip to the client.

## What's deferred (by original spec)

**Gmail OAuth draft creation.** Ships with `mailto:` + `.docx` download instead —
nothing auto-sends, ever. Real Gmail API draft creation is a clean follow-up once this
is proven out.

## Editing the profile

Identity and standing answers have their own fields. The master resume (experience,
education, achievements, skills, projects) is edited as JSON — it's the ground truth
every tailored resume and email is generated fresh from. "Reset to default" restores
the seed data.

## Model registry

`api/_llm.js` (server) and `app.js` (client) both hold a small curated list of
selectable models per provider — keep them in sync if you add/remove a model.
